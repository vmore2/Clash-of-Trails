# 🚀 OTA Updates for Clash of Trails

## What are OTA Updates?

**OTA (Over-The-Air) Updates** allow you to push code changes to your friends' phones **without them needing to reinstall the APK**. They'll get updates automatically!

## ✨ How It Works

1. **You make code changes** (fix bugs, add features, improve UI)
2. **You publish the update** using Expo's OTA system
3. **Your friends get notified** in the app about the update
4. **They tap "Update Now"** and get the latest version instantly
5. **No APK reinstallation needed!** 🎉

## 🛠️ Setup (Already Done!)

✅ **app.json** - Configured for OTA updates  
✅ **eas.json** - Update channels configured  
✅ **App.js** - Update checking logic added  
✅ **Update notification UI** - Shows when updates are available  

## 📱 How to Publish Updates

### Option 1: Using the Script (Recommended)
```bash
npm run update
```

### Option 2: Manual Command
```bash
npx expo publish
```

### Option 3: Using EAS (Advanced)
```bash
eas update --branch production
```

## 🔄 Update Flow

1. **Make your code changes** and save files
2. **Run `npm run update`** to publish
3. **Wait for confirmation** that update is published
4. **Your friends see update notification** in their app
5. **They tap "Update Now"** to get the latest version

## 📋 What Gets Updated

✅ **JavaScript/React Native code** - UI, logic, features  
✅ **App behavior** - New functionality, bug fixes  
✅ **Styling** - Colors, layouts, animations  
✅ **Configuration** - Settings, preferences  

## ❌ What Doesn't Get Updated

❌ **Native code changes** - New permissions, libraries  
❌ **App metadata** - App name, icon, splash screen  
❌ **Major version changes** - These still need new APKs  

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Test locally first** - Make sure your changes work
2. **Publish frequently** - Small updates are better than big ones
3. **Check for errors** - Make sure the update publishes successfully
4. **Inform your friends** - Let them know updates are coming

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Update Not Showing
- Check if the update published successfully
- Make sure friends have internet connection
- Wait a few minutes for the update to propagate

### Update Fails
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure you're logged into Expo (`npx expo login`)
- Try publishing again

### Friends Still See Old Version
- Ask them to manually check for updates
- Make sure they have the latest APK installed
- Some updates may require app restart

## 🎉 Benefits

- **Instant updates** for your friends

- **Professional feel** - like real app store updates
